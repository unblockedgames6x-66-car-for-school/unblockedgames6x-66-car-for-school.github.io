<title>Atari Breakout - Unblocked Games 66</title>
<meta content="Atari Breakout is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1976 by Atari Inc. The game is played using a paddle and a ball, and the objective is to break through a wall of bricks by hitting them with the ball.

In the game, players control the paddle at the bottom of the screen and use it to bounce the ball back up towards the bricks. Each time the ball hits a brick, it will disappear from the screen, and the player will earn points.

Players must be careful not to miss the ball and let it fall off the bottom of the screen, as this will result in losing a life. Players start with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost.

As players progress through each level, the wall of bricks becomes more challenging to break through, with some bricks requiring multiple hits to destroy. There are also power-ups that can be collected by hitting certain bricks, such as larger paddles, multi-balls, and extra lives.

Atari Breakout has become an iconic game that has been remade and adapted for various platforms over the years. Today, it can be played online through web browsers or on mobile devices, providing a nostalgic and entertaining gaming experience for players of all ages." name="description">
