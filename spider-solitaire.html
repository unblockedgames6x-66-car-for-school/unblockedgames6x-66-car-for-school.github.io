<title>Spider Solitaire - Unblocked Games 66</title>
<meta content="Spider Solitaire is a popular single-player card game that is typically played on a computer or mobile device. The game is a variant of the classic solitaire game, and it is played using two decks of cards.

The objective of Spider Solitaire is to arrange all the cards in descending order, from King to Ace, within each of the game's eight tableau piles. To move cards between the tableau piles, players must create runs of cards in descending order with alternating colors. For example, a red Queen can be placed on a black King, followed by a black Jack, a red 10, and so on.

Players can also move entire sequences of cards between tableau piles, as long as they are of the same suit and in descending order. For example, a sequence of cards from the 8 of spades to the 3 of spades can be moved onto another tableau pile if there is an available spot.

The game also features a stock pile and a waste pile. The stock pile contains the remaining cards that have not yet been dealt, while the waste pile contains cards that have been drawn from the stock pile but cannot be played. Players can draw additional cards from the stock pile to add to the tableau piles.

The game is won when all cards have been arranged in descending order within each of the eight tableau piles. However, the game can also end in a stalemate if there are no more moves available.

Spider Solitaire is a challenging game that requires strategic thinking and careful planning. It is available on most computers and mobile devices, making it a convenient and accessible way to enjoy a classic card game." name="description">
