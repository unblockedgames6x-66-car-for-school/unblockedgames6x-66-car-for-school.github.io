<title>Clicker Heroes - Unblocked Games 66</title>
<meta content="
Clicker Heroes is a popular idle game developed by Playsaurus. The game involves clicking on monsters to defeat them and earn gold, which can be used to hire and level up heroes to help defeat stronger monsters. As the player progresses through the game, they can unlock new heroes, upgrade their abilities, and progress through different levels and zones.


The game has a strong focus on "idle" gameplay, meaning that players can continue to earn gold and progress through the game even when they are not actively playing. This is achieved through the use of "auto-clickers," which automate the clicking process.


Overall, Clicker Heroes is a fun and addictive game that has become very popular among casual gamers. However, it is important to note that the game can be quite repetitive and may not appeal to everyone's tastes." name="description">
