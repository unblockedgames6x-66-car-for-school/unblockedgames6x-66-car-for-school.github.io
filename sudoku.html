<title>Sudoku - Unblocked Games 66</title>
<meta content="
Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains all the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle initially contains some of the digits in the grid, which the player has to use to deduce the other digits.

The game was invented in Switzerland in the late 1970s, but it gained international popularity in the early 2000s. Sudoku puzzles can range in difficulty from easy to very challenging, depending on the number of pre-filled digits and the logic required to deduce the missing ones.

Sudoku is often used as a form of mental exercise and is believed to improve cognitive abilities such as memory, concentration, and logical reasoning. It is also a popular pastime among people of all ages and can be found in newspapers, magazines, books, and online." name="description">
