<title>QWOP - Unblocked Games 66</title>
<meta content="QWOP is a popular online game developed by Bennett Foddy in 2008. The game's objective is to control an athlete named "QWOP" and help him run a 100-meter race. However, the controls are deliberately difficult to master, and players must use the Q, W, O, and P keys to move QWOP's thighs and calves to coordinate his movements. 
Due to the game's challenging controls, QWOP has become known for its difficulty and has gained a reputation as one of the hardest games ever made. Despite this, it has also gained a cult following and has been praised for its unique gameplay and humor." name="description">
