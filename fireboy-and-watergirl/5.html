<meta content=""Fireboy and Watergirl 5: Elements" is the fifth installment in the Fireboy and Watergirl game series, also developed by Oslo Albet. This time, the game takes place in a world of different elements such as fire, water, wind, and earth.

In this game, Fireboy and Watergirl must navigate through levels that have different elemental themes. Each level has its own challenges and puzzles that require players to use their unique abilities to solve. For example, Fireboy can interact with fire and lava, while Watergirl can interact with water and ice.

As players progress through the game, they can collect gems and use them to unlock new levels and access bonus levels. There are also hidden mini-games that players can find by completing certain objectives within the levels.

One of the notable features of Fireboy and Watergirl 5 is the addition of new playable characters. In addition to Fireboy and Watergirl, players can also unlock and play as characters with different elemental abilities.

Like the previous games in the series, Fireboy and Watergirl 5 is a fun and challenging puzzle game that requires players to work together and use their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. It also has a multiplayer mode that allows two players to play on the same computer, making it a great option for playing with friends or family." name="description">
